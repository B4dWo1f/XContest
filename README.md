# XContest
This is my first attempt at a spider-like code that collects data (and/or tracks) from a number of pilots.

The idea is to analyze personal advances and possibly in the near future connect flight to weather data

## Requirements
python 3.6+  (some fstrings are used)  
[python-tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)  
[python-selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)  
[geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/)

## Run
In order to run you need to have a file "pilots.txt" with the username of the pilots you want to track.
